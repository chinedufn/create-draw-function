create-draw-function [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chinedufn/create-draw-function.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chinedufn/create-draw-function)
===============

## Background / Initial Motivation

I want the simplest interface possible for creating a WebGL draw call. There are other projects that aim for this, but I like the idea of slowly
adding the functionality that I need and having a deep understanding of the underlying implementation.

## Usage

Maybe I'll add some notes when I've used it in more production scenarios.
